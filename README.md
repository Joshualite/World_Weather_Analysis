# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this work is to use the knowledge we have of python to be able to collect information from websites through the use of APIs, it is assumed that the service is being provided to a fictitious company in order to collect information from everyone to be able to know the different cities that are available depending on the temperatures a user is willing to visit

## Resources
- Data files: WeatherPy_vacation.csv,  Weather_Database.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.0 , Anaconda , Jupyter


## Results

In order to verify the results, 3 tests were requested, the first one was to generate a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, then we have to retrieve the nearest city and perform an API call with the OpenWeatherMap, so that we can assure  that the info was downloaded correctly.At the end we would have a database with which we could work and be able to test an API call

The second test that was requested was that once we have our database, and depending on the user's preferences in terms of climate and temperature range, to be able to show an image where it shows all the available cities according to the conditions that he dictated at the time of doing the search

And finally, the last test that was asked to carry out, was to be able to show through an image, a route plan where a trip was traced through several cities in the same country, and that also meets the conditions imposed by the user.
